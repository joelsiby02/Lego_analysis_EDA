Welcome to my Lego dataset analysis project! In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and answered two real-world questions about the popularity of Star Wars as a licensed theme in the Lego dataset. 

Through data analysis and visualization, I was able to determine the percentage of licensed sets that were Star Wars themed and identify the year in which Star Wars was not the most popular licensed theme. 

Overall, this project showcases my skills in data analysis and EDA, and provides valuable insights into the world of Lego sets. I hope you find my findings and analysis both informative and engaging!
